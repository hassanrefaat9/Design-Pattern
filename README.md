# Design Pattern
A design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
Design patterns provide a way to describe best practices and proven solutions for developing software in a structured 
and organized manner.
## Types of Design Patterns

  hese patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
  Examples of creational patterns include Singleton, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory.
* **Structural patterns:**  
  These patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.
  Examples of structural patterns include Adapter, Facade, and Decorator.
* **Behavioral patterns:**   
These patterns deal with object interaction and communication, defining how objects communicate with one another
to achieve certain goals. Examples of behavioral patterns include Observer, Command, and Strategy .
